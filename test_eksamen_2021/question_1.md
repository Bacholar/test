**We have looked at some static analysis tools like StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs and SonarLint. Explain how static analysis can improve code quality. Explain how it helped you or could have helped you in your project.**

* StyleCop, PMD, FindBugs
* Linters, SonarLint
* Security


Static code analysis, is a method of debugging a computer program by examining the code without executing the program.
Is used by software developer and QA teams (Quality assurance team).

It finds:
* programming errors
* coding standard violations
* undefined values
* syntax violations
* security vulnerabilities

Without those tools, humans would have to check the code and that would be waste of resources.

**Types of static analysis**

* control analysis
* data analysis
* fault/failure analysis
* interface analysis

**Benefits**

* increase code quality
* provides speed compared to manual code review
* can be done offline

**Drawbacks**

* things that are ok are shown as false
* doesn't necessarily find all mistakes
* system and third-party libaries may not be able to be 
* not all coding rules can be followed
