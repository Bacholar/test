* Red, Green, Refactor
* Testable code
* Maintainable code
* Equivalence partitions
* Positive, negative tests


**Test Driven Development**

* write test before write production code

1. Add a test.
2. Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
3. Write some code.
4. Run tests and Refactor code.
5. Repeat.
