## 1.4 Explain test activities, and how they are related to each other. Then explain the test activities you carried out in your project.

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Refactoring
* Maintenance
* Continuous Integration
* Code reviews

## Test Activities

1. **Test planning**

Test planning involves producing a document that describes an overall approach and test objectives. It involves reviewing the test basis, identifying the test conditions based on analysis of test items, writing test cases and Designing the test environment. Completion or exit criteria must be specified so that we know when testing (at any stage) is complete.

* scope, objectives, risks
* overall approach
* how to begin and proceed with testing. Creating a plan.
* what do we want to test
* when do we test ? Time of execution of the tests.
* budgeting for the test activities
* level of test documentations
* select metrics for test monitoring and control

2. **Test monitoring and control**

This is the activity of comparing actual progress against the plan, and reporting the status, including deviations from the plan. It involves taking actions necessary to meet the mission and objectives of the project.

* comparison report of actual progress against planned progress
* how far are we from our test objectives and what do we have to do reach them
* define and set criteria

3. **Test analysis**

    * "what to test"
    * identifying features and sets of features to be tested
    * defining and prioritizing test conditions for each feature based on analysis of the test basis, and considering functional, non-functional, and structural characteristics, other business and technical factors, and levels of risks
    * to review the test basis. The test basis is the information on which test cases are based, such as requirements, design specifications, product risk analysis, architecture and interfaces
    * to identify test conditions

4. **Test design**

    * "how to test ?"
    * to design the tests
    * to design the test environment set-up and identify the required infrastructure and tools

5. **Test implementation**

    * “do we now have everything in place to run the tests?”
    * preparing test data and ensuring it is properly loaded in the test environment
    * to develop and prioritize test cases by using techniques and create test data for those tests.
    * to create test suites from the test cases for efficient test execution. Test suite is a collection of test cases that are used to test a software program 

6. **Test execution**

Test execution involves actually running the specified test on a computer system either manually or by using an automated test tool. It is a Fundamental Test Process in which actual work is done.

* comparing actual results with expected results
* reporting defects based on the failures observed
* logging the outcome of test execution (e.g., pass, fail, blocked)
* to re-execute the tests that previously failed in order to confirm a fix.

7. **Test completion**

Test closure activities are done when software is ready to be delivered. The testing can be closed for the other reasons also like:


    * when a project is cancelled
    * when some target is achieved
    * when a maintenance release or update is done


* creating a test summary report to be communicated to stakeholders
* handing over the test-ware to the maintenance teams, other project teams, and/or other stakeholders who could benefit from its use
* using the information gathered to improve test process maturity
* analyzing lessons learned from the completed test activities to determine changes needed for future iterations, releases, and projects
