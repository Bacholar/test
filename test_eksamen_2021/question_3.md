We can look at organizational documents as for example:

* policies
* strategies
* plans
* reports
* sales and marketing material

or we can look at the plans for the

* product
* project
* quality assurance
* test
* configuration management
* supplier agreements

or we can look at the test reports

* component testing
* integration testing
* system testing
* acceptance testing

## Static test Standards

* IEEE 1028 Standard for Software Reviews and Audits
    * The ISO 9000 family of quality management systems (QMS) is a set of standards that helps organizations ensure they meet customer and other stakeholder needs within statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.
* CMMI Capability Maturity Model Integration
    * The ISO 9000 family of quality management systems (QMS) is a set of standards that helps organizations ensure they meet customer and other stakeholder needs within statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.
* ISO 9001, ISO 15504(SPICE)
    * The ISO 9000 family of quality management systems (QMS) is a set of standards that helps organizations ensure they meet customer and other stakeholder needs within statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.

**IEEE 1028**

IEEE defines a number of static test levels:

    1. Informal review
    2. Walk-through
    3. Technical review
    4. Management review
    5. Inspection
    6. Audit

## Tools that can be used

* **Code with me** https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html
* GitHub
        * Protected branch (requires a review before merging a protected branch)
        * Require pull request with review
